The `AwsuiTheme` component allows you to easily apply your brand's theme to your
[AWS UI components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@awsui/components-react).

## Install

- `npm install awsui-theme` or
- `yarn add awsui-theme`

## Use

To use a custom AWS UI theme, wrap the `AwsuiTheme` component around your
application. While `AwsuiTheme` does not currently use React contexts, this
wrapper would most likely be placed alongside your React context providers, such
as React Router or Redux.

```javascript
import AwsuiTheme from 'awsui-theme';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AwsuiTheme>
      <Home />
    </AwsuiTheme>
  );
}
```

## Props

The `AwsuiTheme` takes any number of props specifying design tokens for your
theme. These props are more or less equivalent to the design tokens you would
find in the
[@awsui/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@awsui/design-tokens)
package.

With TypeScript support, the known design tokens should auto-complete in your
development environment. There may be more, unknown design tokens that do not
auto-complete. You may specify _any_ value as a prop, and the `AwsuiTheme`
component will attempt to find that design token in the document.

For example, if the CSS variable you want to manipulate is called
`--color-test-xyz`, but `colorTest` does not auto-complete as a prop, you may
still specify it anyway: `colorTest="red"`. The component will scan the document
for CSS variables named `--color-test-xyz` and change those values for all
child nodes.

An example `AwsuiTheme` implementation that changes the primary action color
from blue to red may look like this:

```javascript
import AwsuiTheme from 'awsui-theme';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AwsuiTheme colorTextAccent="red">
      <Home />
    </AwsuiTheme>
  );
}
```

## `AwsuiThemeRootSelector`

You may want to apply your theme to a different element than the wrapper created
by the `AwsuiTheme` component. For example, in order to support
[`CollectionPreferences`](#collectionpreferences), you may want to apply your
theme to your `body` element.

To do this, wrap your `AwsuiTheme` component in the `AwsuiThemeRootSelector`
context. This allows you to specify the CSS selector to which your theme is
applied.

```javascript
import AwsuiTheme, { AwsuiThemeRootSelector } from 'awsui-theme';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AwsuiThemeRootSelector.Provider value="body">
      <AwsuiTheme colorTextAccent="red">
        <Home />
      </AwsuiTheme>
    </AwsuiThemeRootSelector.Provider>
  );
}
```

In the above example, the `--color-text-accent` CSS variable is now applied to
`body` instead of `.awsui-theme-1`.

## F.A.Q.

### `CollectionPreferences`

> What do I do if my `CollectionPreferences` component is still unthemed?

AWS UI mounts the `CollectionPreferences` as a child node of your `body`
element. As a result, it falls outside of the wrapper generated by the
`AwsuiTheme` component.

Currently, AWS UI does not offer a way to mount the `CollectionPreferences`
component anywhere other than the `body` element. To style the
`CollectionPreferences` component, you must apply your AWS UI theme to your
`body` element. To do this, see
[`AwsuiThemeRootSelector`](#awsuithemerootselector).
